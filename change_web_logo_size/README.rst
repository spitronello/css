Change Logo Size.
===========================

This Module change the logo size.

Configuration
=============

Dependencies:
-------------
The module website_less needs to be installed for this theme to work properly.
If this is the first theme you install, follow these steps to enable theme
layer dependencies:

- sudo apt-get install -y npm
- sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
- sudo npm install -g less less-plugin-clean-css

The website_less module can be found here:

- https://www.odoo.com/apps/8.0/website_less/

There is no public repo for that module, AFAIK, if you find it, please give us
a hint.

After installing dependencies, install theme_redandwhite as you would with any
other odoo module and that's it.

Customization
-------------
-Social media button links are hardcoded in redandwhite_header and
redandwhite_footer files, edit the img tags so they point to your desired URLs.

-The theme was created from a custom design and its aim is following blueprints
instead of making it fully customizable. If you come up with any ideas to make
this theme more attractive for general use, please share them, we will really
appreciate your feedback.

Known issues
============

This is a work in progress, if you find any issues, please refer to next point.
